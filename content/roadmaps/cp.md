# Competitive Programming Mastery Roadmap

Competitive programming (CP) is a challenging and rewarding pursuit for those who enjoy problem-solving and coding. This roadmap is designed to take you from the basics to advanced algorithmic mastery.

## Phase 0: The Mindset (Free Time Content)

Before diving into code, understand the philosophy and strategy behind top-tier competitive programmers.

- **How to Solve Questions**: [Dominater Version](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133289)
- **How to read problem statements**: [By Umnik](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62730)

## Phase 1: Fundamentals & Language Selection

The first step is to master a programming language. **C++** is highly recommended due to its speed and extensive Standard Template Library (STL).

### 1.1 Language Basics
- **C++**: [Learn here](https://rb.gy/qozyb9)
- **Java**: [Learn here](https://rb.gy/kndsgg)
- **Python**: [Learn here](https://rb.gy/zqzyse)

### 1.2 Standard Libraries
Mastering these is essential for efficient coding. Instead of writing common data structures from scratch, you use these built-in libraries:
- **C++**: Learn the **STL Library** (Vectors, Sets, Maps, Stacks). [STL Guide](https://rb.gy/2m5ye4)
- **Java**: Learn the **Collections Library**. [Collections Guide]

## Phase 2: Basic Problem Solving

Solve at least 5–10 problems for each topic to build a strong foundation. Use these practice sets to get started:

- **Topics**:-
- **Data Types**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/w0hlu6)
- **Loops**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/ulhahs)
- **Arrays**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/uswexq)
- **Strings**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/jg8m8z)
- **Functions**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/6f6cmn)
- **Maths & Geometry**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/n1z2kw)
- **Recursion**: [Problems](https://rb.gy/ogu7ca)
- **General Practice**: [Set 1](https://rb.gy/q9z5mc) | [Set 2](https://rb.gy/lcanu4) | [Set 3](https://rb.gy/b7eggz)

## Phase 3: Practice Platforms

Start solving actual competitive programming questions on these recommended platforms:

- **Codeforces (The Gold Standard)**: Focus on the Problem Set. Start by sorting by "number of submissions" and set difficulty to **800**. Participate in Div. 3 and Div. 4 contests. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset)
- **AtCoder**: Excellent for increasing speed and practicing implementation. Try the AtCoder Beginner Contests (ABC). [AtCoder Archive](https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive)
- **CodeChef**: Great for beginners and topic-specific practice via CodeChef Starters. [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)

## Phase 4: Intermediate Topics

Study these from YouTube, GFG, or CP-Algorithms, then solve 20–25 questions on each:

- **Binary Search**: [Resource 1](https://rb.gy/brjrp6) | [Resource 2](https://rb.gy/5bwfs8) 
- **Bit Manipulation**: [Resource 1](https://rb.gy/q2shqj) | [Resource 2](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/bit-manipulation.html)
- **Two Pointers**: [Resource 1](https://rb.gy/xjtqj6) 
- **Greedy and Sorting**: [Resource](https://rb.gy/g5muuj)
- **Number Theory Basics**: [Resource](https://rb.gy/85dtt0)

## Phase 5: Benchmarking Progress

Try giving **Virtual Contests** on Codeforces and aim for these targets to ensure you are improving:
- **Div-2**: Solve 2–3 questions (up to problem C).
- **Div-3**: Solve 4–5 questions (up to problem E).
- **Div-4**: Solve 5–6 questions (up to problem F).

## Phase 6: Advanced Topics

Once comfortable, move to advanced algorithms:

### 6.1 Number Theory & Combinatorics :- [Resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCq5TYMZEwg&list=PLauivoElc3giVROwL-6g9hO-LlSen_NaV)
- **Advanced Number Theory**: [Inverse Modulo](https://rb.gy/wgafwd) | [Extended Euclidean](https://rb.gy/hawlyq)
- **Combinatorics**: [Basics](https://rb.gy/by3nyy) | [Inclusion/Exclusion](https://rb.gy/z9rz07) | [Catalan Numbers](https://rb.gy/kmey9e)

### 6.2 Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Trees & Graphs**:[Overview](https://rb.gy/ubri0q)|[Tutorial](https://repovive.com/roadmaps/graph-theory)
